Helpers for LÃ¶ve2D

Utility classes for stuff frequently used in game development.

In there, you'll find:
- a vector 2D class, with all the usual operations,
- a state machine class, and a state class,
- a control class, which supports key presses, key held, and some mouse function,
- a hibox class, with collisions and all.

main.lua is here to show how those classes are used.
